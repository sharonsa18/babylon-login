# babylon-login
I developed a simple login application using Next.js with Firebase Authentication, focusing on functionality, design, and user experience. The application consists of two main pages: a Login Page and a Homepage.
On the Login Page, users can enter their Full Name, Email Address, and Password. Firebase Authentication handles both user registration and login, ensuring secure access. Once logged in, users are redirected to the Homepage, where they are greeted personally by their name.

In terms of design, I emphasized simplicity and clarity. The layout is centered for better alignment, with input fields and the login button neatly positioned inside a styled card. To enhance the interface, I included hover effects, which make the input fields pop out slightly when hovered over, improving interactivity and engagement. Additionally, I placed an image on the right side of the container for balance, ensuring it fits properly without zooming in excessively by using CSS properties like object-fit: contain.
One important design decision was keeping the background minimal to maintain focus on the login card. However, I also considered adding gradient backgrounds or subtle patterns in future versions to make the interface more dynamic.
If I were to extend this project, I would implement Tailwind CSS for styling. Tailwind would simplify the process of creating modern, responsive designs with utility classes, reducing the need for writing extensive custom CSS. It would also speed up future design iterations.
=======
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
